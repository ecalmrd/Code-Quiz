# Module_4_Challenge
## Code Quiz
We were to create a code quiz in this assignment. The acceptance criteria included having a timer, a record of the score and player, and include 5 multiple choice questions with 4 choices for each question. The score would also be based on the amount of correct or incorrect answers and length of time it takes to complete the assignment. This assignment is still a work in progress.
